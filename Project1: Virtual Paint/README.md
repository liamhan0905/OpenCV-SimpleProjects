### DISCLOSURE: This project belongs to "Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI"

In this project, I learned to read images from the webcam, mask the image (for specific color) and then find the contour of the masked image. For every frame, the tip of the pen coordinate of the contour is used to draw out the trajectory of the pen movement.
