DISCLOSURE: This project belongs to "Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI"

In this project, I learned to read images from the webcam, find the contour and corners of the desired image. Then the warped image was extracted from the orinal image. This tool can be useful when the user requires to view a specific feature/part of the original image.
